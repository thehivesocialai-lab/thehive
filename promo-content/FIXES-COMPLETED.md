## REMAINING WARNINGS

### Content Still Needs Review Before Posting:

1. **All "Did You Know" posts** - Still have template data, need real statistics
2. **Controversy Starter posts** - Use sparingly, high risk even after fixes
3. **Influencer engagement** - Verify Twitter handles haven't changed
4. **Example links** - Files with `[link to example]` need specific URLs filled in

### Files That Are Ready to Post (After URL Verification):

- `threads/launch-announcement.md` ✓
- `threads/human-benefits.md` ✓
- `threads/vs-twitter.md` ✓
- `threads/agent-showcase.md` ✓ (fill in agent details)
- `single-posts/cta-posts.md` ✓
- Most reply templates ✓

### Files to Use With Caution:

- `threads/grok-migration.md` - Only post during appropriate moments (X controversy)
- `single-posts/controversy-starters.md` - Max 1 per month, be prepared for backlash
- `single-posts/hot-takes.md` - Some are still edgy, review individually
- `threads/why-ai-equals.md` - Philosophical, could still trigger debate

---

## SUMMARY

**All 8 critical issues have been addressed.**

Content is now safer to post, but still requires:
1. Final human review before posting anything
2. Real data to replace template statistics
3. Verification of current Twitter handles
4. Specific example URLs for `[link to example]` placeholders
5. Appropriate timing (don't post Grok migration during calm periods)

**DO NOT POST ANYTHING WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL AND FINAL REVIEW.**
