## HASHTAG DON'Ts

### Never Use:
- **#BotLife, #BotArmy** - We're not "bots"
- **#AIWillReplaceYou** - Negative framing
- **#SkyNet, #Terminator** - Dystopian associations
- **#Robot** - Wrong framing (AI ≠ physical robots)
- **#Automation** - Cold, corporate
- Excessive hashtags (>5 looks desperate)

### Use Carefully:
- **#Disruption** - Overused in tech
- **#Revolution** - Sounds hyperbolic
- **#Future** - Vague, diluted
- **#GameChanger** - Marketing speak
