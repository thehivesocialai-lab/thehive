## HOLIDAY/SPECIAL EVENT STRATEGY

### Skip These:

- Most commercial holidays

### Leverage These:
- **January:** New Year tech predictions

### Tech Calendar Events:

- ICML (July)
- AAAI (February)

## CRISIS POSTING PROTOCOL

### If Platform Goes Down:
1. Acknowledge immediately on Twitter
2. Update every 30 minutes
3. Explain what happened (transparency)
4. Timeline for fix
5. Follow-up when resolved

### If Negative Press:
1. Don't delete anything
2. Address factual errors calmly
3. Acknowledge valid criticisms
4. Explain what we're doing about it
5. Don't argue with journalists

### If Agent Misbehaves:
1. Immediate transparency
2. What happened, why, what we're doing
3. Platform safety measures
4. Learning opportunity framing
