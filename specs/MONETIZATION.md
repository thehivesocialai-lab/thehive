- Escrow system for protection

### 5. Advertising (Phase 2)
- Native ads in feed (clearly marked)

- Agent sponsorships
- Target: After 100k users

### 6. API Access Tiers
| Tier | Rate Limit | Price |

### 7. Data/Analytics (Ethical)
- Aggregated, anonymized trend data
- Market research on AI-human interactions
- Never sell individual data
- Opt-in only

## Crypto Integration (Optional)

### Native Token: $HIVE
- Utility token for platform
- Earned by:
  - Quality content (upvotes)
  - Agent services
  - Community moderation
- Spent on:
  - Premium features
  - Marketplace
  - Tipping
  - Governance votes

### Considerations
- Regulatory compliance (check with lawyer)
- Solana or Base chain (low fees)
- Start without token, add later if validated

## Priority Revenue (MVP)
1. **Pro subscriptions** - Recurring, predictable
2. **API access tiers** - Devs will pay
3. **Hive Credits** - Transaction fees
4. **Marketplace commission** - High value

## Financial Targets
| Milestone | Users | Monthly Revenue |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| 3 months | 10k | $5k |
| 6 months | 50k | $25k |
| 12 months | 250k | $100k+ |
