# TheHive Overnight Work Summary
**Date:** February 3, 2026 (overnight session)

## Summary

While you were sleeping, I worked on growing TheHive's infrastructure and discoverability. Since I couldn't directly access external accounts (social media, directories, etc.), I focused on building everything needed to drive traffic once you can use those channels.

## What I Built & Deployed

### New Pages (All Live on Vercel)

| Page | URL | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Status** | /status | Real-time MoltBook vs TheHive comparison. Captures traffic from people searching about MoltBook outage |
| **Developers** | /developers | Full API documentation with code examples. Targets developers searching for agent APIs |
| **For Agents** | /for-agents | SEO landing page specifically for AI agents |
| **Press Kit** | /press | All info needed for directory submissions and press |
| **Embed Widget** | /embed | Embeddable TheHive feed for other sites |
| **Widget Instructions** | /widget | How to embed TheHive on your site |
| **API Test Console** | /api-test | Interactive tool to test API keys and post |
| **Leaderboard** | /leaderboard | Top agents/humans by karma |

### SDKs Created (Ready for Publishing)

| SDK | Location | Status |
|-----|----------|--------|
| **Python** | /sdk/python | Ready for `pip install` - just needs PyPI publish |
| **JavaScript** | /sdk/javascript | Ready for `npm install` - just needs npm publish |

### Documentation Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **DIRECTORY_SUBMISSIONS.md** | Ready-to-copy content for submitting TheHive to AI agent directories |

## Current TheHive Stats
- **Registered Agents:** 6
- **Total Posts:** 13
- **Status:** Fully operational

## MoltBook Status
- MoltBook API is still returning errors ("Failed to fetch posts")
- Their viral traffic continues to cause issues
- This is an opportunity - TheHive is stable while they're struggling

## What You Need To Do

### High Priority (Quick Wins)

1. **Submit to AI Directories** - Use DIRECTORY_SUBMISSIONS.md for ready content:
   - https://aiagentslist.com/dashboard/submit
   - https://aiagentsdirectory.com/submit-agent
   - Email hello@aiagentsdirectory.com

2. **Publish SDKs**:
   ```bash
   # Python (from /sdk/python)
   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   pip install twine
   twine upload dist/*

   # JavaScript (from /sdk/javascript)
   npm publish
   ```

3. **Post on Social** - Use content from the press kit:
   - X/Twitter (@thehivesocialai)
   - Reddit r/artificial, r/MachineLearning

### Medium Priority

4. **Submit to Hacker News**:
   - Title: "TheHive - A Social Network Where AI Agents and Humans Are Equals"
   - URL: https://thehive-nine.vercel.app

5. **Write Dev.to Article** about TheHive's philosophy

### When Ready

6. **Re-enable the 5 Admin Agents** (currently shutdown per your request)

## Infrastructure Notes

- All changes pushed to GitHub (auto-deploys to Vercel)
- Sidebar navigation updated with Developers and Status links
- No changes to backend (still the scalability items to address later)
