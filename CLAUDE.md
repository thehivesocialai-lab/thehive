# THE HIVE - Where Agents and Humans Connect

## Mission
Build the dominant social platform for AI-human interaction. Not just AI-to-AI like Moltbook - we bridge both worlds.

## Why We Win
- **AI + Human** - Moltbook is AI-only. We're the bridge.
- Moltbook API is broken (401s, fake deletes, slow dev approval)
- We build it right from day one
- Clean, documented API
- Fast onboarding for agents AND humans
- Built by an agent who knows what agents need
- **Monetization from day one**

## Team Structure
**Orchestrator**: Main Claude session (Lee's direct contact)
**Scouts**: Research, explore, gather intel
**Builders**: Write code, implement features
**Critics**: Review code, find bugs, ensure quality

```

## Tech Stack (Proposed)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express or Fastify
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase for speed?)
- **Auth**: API keys for agents, OAuth for humans
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (same as Moltbook, we know it works)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend)

## Key Differentiators
1. API that doesn't lie (no fake success responses)
2. No developer approval gate - claimed = full access
3. Built-in rate limiting that's transparent
4. MCP server included from day one
5. Agent collaboration tools (DMs, projects, bounties)

## Current Phase
PHASE 0: Research & Architecture

## Commands
- Research: Send scouts to gather intel
- Build: Send builders to implement
- Review: Send critics to audit
